            aspects of the box model:

                1. The dimensions of an element’s box.
                2. The borders of an element’s box.
                3. The paddings of an element’s box.
                4. The margins of an element’s box.

            box model 
                - all elements on a web page are interpreted by the browser as “living” inside of a box.

                - comprises the set of properties that define parts of an element that take up space on a web page.

                - includes the content area's size (width, height)

                - includes the elements padding, border, and margin.

                    - width & height: width & height of the content area.

                    - padding: the amount of space between the content area and the boarder.

                    - border: the thickness and style of the border surrounding the content area padding.

                    - margin: the amount of space between the border and the outside edge of the element.



            background color - when you change the background color of an element, 
            you change the background color of its entire box. 

            borders - a line that surrounds an element, like a frame around a painting. Borders can be set with a specific width, style, and color.
                - width - thickness of the border. 
                        - thickness can be ser with pixels, thin, medium, thick.

                - style - the design of the border.
                        - styles; none, dotted, solid etc.

                - color - The color of the border. Web browsers can render colors using a few different formats.

            border-radius - modify the corners of an element’s border box (curvature).

            padding - the amount of space between the content area and the boarder.

                    - like the space between a picture and the frame surrounding it.

                    - often used to expand the background color and make the content look less cramped.

                    - to be more specific about the amount of padding on each side of a box’s content, use properties:

                        - padding-top - space between the content area and the boarder (left side).

                        - padding-right - space between the content area and the boarder (right side).

                        - padding-bottom - space between the content area and the boarder (top side).

                        - paddding-left - space between the content area and the boarder (bottom side).
